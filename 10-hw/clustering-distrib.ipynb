    "# Hierarchical clustering based on semantics, and on syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "White et al. 2014 asked how much information syntax holds about semantics, and vice versa, by considering English attitude verbs: verbs of mental attitude such as *believe* or *want*, or of communication such as *say* or *claim*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "They collected data from human participants concerning the semantic similarity among such attitude verbs, and separately collected data concerning the syntactic acceptability of the same attitude verbs in a variety of different syntactic frames.  Using [hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering), they found a particular clustering of these verbs by semantics, and a similar but not identical clustering by syntax.  You will attempt to replicate those findings, starting from their data, which they kindly [posted online](https://github.com/aaronstevenwhite/ProjectionExperiments) and which have been downloaded for you and included in this homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework does not cover the maxent modeling part of the same paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many thanks to [Geoff Bacon](https://geoffbacon.github.io/) for writing the first draft of this notebook."

As with pandas and sklearn, someone else has done the work of finding reliable ways to carry out an important set of common tasks, and you just need to use these already-written routines.

    "Things aren't panning out quite as cleanly this time.  Both the number of frames and the number of participants are off a bit.  This is enough to raise the suspicion that we might have the wrong data file - but I did not find anything obviously more appropriate, so let's stick with this one: it's also possible that some data and participants were dropped from the analysis without that being noted in the paper.  These slightly discrepant numbers mean that we are necessarily aiming for merely approximate replication.  For this reason we'll skip the [ridit transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridit_scoring) and the (under-described in any event) item correction that White et al. refer to on p. 3, and just treat the data as we find them.\n",
    "\n",
    "White et al. created their syntactic dissimilarity matrix as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [The acceptability] scores were then averaged, resulting in one\n",
    "score for each verb-construction pair—34 scores per verb. (p. 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "> To obtain distances between our verbs from the syntactic compatibility judgments, we can\n",
    "think of each verb as a point with 34 dimensions—one dimension for each of our 34 syntactic constructions. We can then take the Minkowski (k = 3) distance between each verb and each other verb, resulting in a dissimilarity (distance) matrix with the same dimensions as the semantic similarity matrix. (pp. 5-6)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since we only found 30 constructions rather than 34 as White et al. report, we will have 30 scores per verb, and correspondingly each verb will be a point in a 30-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our first step, as before, will be creating the dissimilarity matrix, this time as described above.  To do this, you may want to use groupby in Pandas - we have already used it briefly but if you want a refresher or more detail, here is a [pretty thorough overview](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html)."
